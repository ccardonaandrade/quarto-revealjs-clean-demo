## Example slide
  
### This is a subtitle
  
Before we dive a bit deeper, here is a simple example of the
[clean theme](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean)
in action. 

- No pictures or anything fancy. Just text for the moment.

Next, we'll take a brief tour of some theme components.

- We'll use the same basic
structure as the
[original LaTeX slides](https://raw.githack.com/kylebutts/templates/master/latex-slides/auxiliary/slides.pdf).
- Note that the [_full suite_](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)
of Reveal.js features are available for this Quarto implementation,
even if we don't cover everything here.


## Before you proceed...

### Requirements for the coding examples in this demo

The [clean theme](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean) is
language agnostic. Use it with R, Python, Julia, etc. Or none of the above.

However, this demo uses R code to highlight advanced theme features.
You'll need to install some software if you'd like to render the demo "as-is".

:::{.callout-warning}

## Required software (this demo only)

### R packages

```{.r}
install.packages(c("modelsummary", "fixest", "pdftools", "tinytex", "threejs"))
```
### TinyTex

```{.bash}
quarto install tinytex
```
While reveal.js presentations are HTML format, we will show an example of how to 
embed LaTeX tables as images. This requires a working Tex distribution, of which
TinyTex provides by far the easiest and lightest integration with Quarto. More
details [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html).

### Alerts & Cross-refs {#sec-crossref}

To emphasize specific words or text, you can:

- Use the default `.alert` class, e.g. [important note]{.alert}.
- Use the `.fg` class for custom colour, e.g. [important note]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"}.
- Use the `.bg` class for custom background, e.g. [important note]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}.
